## About The Project

This just started off as a joke, but the intent was to learn more about CSS and animations in particular. To do this, I first located an open-source illustration that I could download as an SVG. Next, I took the SVG image and opened it up in Figma. Here, changes can be made to the shapes, paths, vectors, etc. that make up the image. I made the changes I wanted, grouped and named each section that I wanted to animate with CSS, and then exported the file from Figma as an SVG. In Figma, you must ensure to click the checkbox 'include id attribute' before exporting the SVG. Now, each section of the image has an id tag that can be acessed with CSS and animated. The SVG info gets embedded inline inside the HTML file with the svg tag.

### Built With

This application was created in VS Code using HTML and CSS. The alien image was found online and edited using Figma. A CDN was used to import the font awesome reddit alien icon. This project is in the style of a landing-page or single page web site and been made responsive for different size devices.

Some of the techniques I used here include CSS flexbox and grid, CSS animations, and animation delays to animate individual paths of an SVG image. CSS Media queries were then used to make the page responsive between a laptop and a smaller mobile device.
